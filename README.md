# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website! 
This project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information using a modern web stack. Built with HTML, CSS, and React.js, the website provides a clean and structured presentation of my work and professional background.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main folders:

- **Assets**: Contains all the images used throughout the website. This centralization makes it easy to manage and update visuals.
- **Data**: Stores all the data displayed on the website, such as personal detais, project details, and resume information. This separation allows for easy edits and updates.
- **Components**: Includes all the reusable React components, such as layouts, modals, and form fields. These components are designed to be modular and easily maintainable.
- **Pages**: Holds all the different pages of the website, such as About Me, Resume, Portfolio, Skills, and Contact Me.
- **Style**: Provides a boilerplate for the project's styling, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the site.

## Website Sections

The website is divided into the following key sections:

1. **About Me**: Introduction with a brief biography and background overview.
2. **Resume**: Detailed view of my education, certifications, achievements, and leadership experiences.
3. **Portfolio**: Displays selected projects with descriptions, visuals, and live links.
4. **Skills**: Highlights the technical skills and tools I’m proficient in.
5. **Contact Me**: Includes a contact form and other ways to connect with me.

## Component and Data Flow

The flow of components and data in the website follows this structure:

1. **Pages** --> **Components** --> **Data** --> **Assets**

   - **Pages** use **Components** to structure each section.
   - **Components** dynamically render content using the **Data** folder.
   - **Data** may reference media files from the **Assets** folder.


## Key Features

   - **Semantic HTML** for accessibility and SEO.
